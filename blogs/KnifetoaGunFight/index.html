                    Yesterday, the entire breathed a collective sigh of relief as a jury of six white, four black and two multi-racial men and women convicted Derek Chauvin on all of the counts of murder and manslaughter of which he was accused.

                    <br><br>
                    In an exclusive interview with USA Today, former President George W. Bush, when asked about the trial's impact on the racial reckoning that the country is undergoing he said, "I think the first thing is that people know that the trial was conducted fairly and the rule of law runs supreme in our judiciary." Justice was indeed served yesterday and our collective outrage at the George Floyd's senseless murder was validated.
                    <br><br>
                    Many were nervous that a non-guilty verdict yesterday would have resulted in violent protests and destruction, which is not an unfounded given similar occurrences in the nation's past. One of the most famous being the 1992 Los Angeles riots following the Rodney King trial. An explosion of rage erupted in LA that day when a jury of which ten out of the thirteen men were white, acquitted police officer in an incident that is at least comparable in its brutality and reckless disregard of the life of a black human being. Justice was not served that day, at least not in the court of popular opinion. The collective skepticism that Black Americans must have felt toward the justice system had a long history, and was validated that day. People took to the streets, and the rest is history. Gladly, history did not repeat itself yesterday; the guilty were found guilty. 
                    <br><br>
                    This begs the question, has the justice system as a judiciary body grown, changed, or evolved since then? If Rodney King was encircled today, swarmed by vulturous, hateful, white, male police officers would this not inspired our collective outrage. The racial lines over which the perception of police violence distorts have arguably never been weaker.

                    I remember my mother marveling at the diversity amongst the protestors who came out in the summer of COVID to make their voices heard. As someone who lived through the LA riots, she could attest that multitudes of white men and women (amongst other groups), joining bands of black activists in the streets in concordant disgust is a new phenomenon. Indeed the entire world united to denounce this hateful act in 2021. The George Floyd saga has demonstrated that the world's sensitivity to black pain and black death is at least so much we can count on the majority of the American public to call a spade a spade, regardless of their race. And this should be a celebrated indicator that perhaps bigots are going the way of the VHS tape.

                    A California court got it wrong in 1992, a Minnesota court got it right in 2021. Tucker Carlson, notorious right-winged shill intertextualizes a collection the statement of Maxine Waters and President Joe Biden pre-empting the verdict with their own opinions about the Chauvin's guilt in a segment called, "Tucker reacts to politicization of Derek Chauvin trial". I didn't bother research Carlson's past statements on the trail, but in this segment he stopped short of discrediting the notion of a guilty verdict being "the right verdict", to use the words of President Biden. He may also be able to call in a spade a spade. He is critiquing the undermining of the judiciary process, highlighting the fact that the presumption of innocence and even the presumption of the absence of racist intent may be woefully lost on the jurors of the court of public opinion. What is at stake here is precisely the fear that faint hearted conservatives harbor: that the American judicial system in its striving year after year to become more equitable may be becoming overly sensitive to black pain and black death. This fear is obviously unfounded: the judicial system cannot be canceled, and, being the highest court in the land, evolves at its own pace and is not responsive to marches and hashtag campaigns. But the aftermath of an impasse between these two courts, have proven to be destructive clashes, regardless of who is right or wrong.

                    This morning may mark the beginnings of such a confrontation. The name of Makhia Bryant, the 16 year old black girl who was fatally shot by police as she attacked another black girl with a kitchen knife, is currently trending on Twitter, along with "taser." Anyone who opines that the officer should have tried to use a taser instead of his firearm, or that he could have shot her in the leg, knows nothing about tasers, nor of firearms, nor of life. For if the officer hadn't responded as he had: as he has been trained to, the girl in pink would have become the girl in red and her family would be in mourning.

                    Admittedly this is just my opinion. But I understand that it is not my job to distill justice from these types of situations, we have the justice department for that. I happen to think that they will also see this the way I do, and that were Mahkia Bryant white, and not black, that neither assessment would change. However, if she were white those same contrarians may not have that same sensitivity. Indeed, the horrifically tragic sight of a young black girl shot four times in the chest, is sad and could easily fit in the canon of this kind of racialized violence, but it's flimsy legitimacy as such, among the Rodney Kings, George Floyds, and Sandra Blands is completely ignored on Twitter and it assuredly will not be in the court of law, nor will it be ignored by skeptical full or faint hearted conservatives. Her case likely will not go to court: if one understand how the court judges about deadly force, one sees why there is little reason for it to, as tragic as her death may be.

                    Despite being hopeful that proper justice would be administered, Americans probably knew how the courts of 1992 would reason about the aggression they witnessed toward Rodney King, about his humanity. This time around the American public were likely skeptical but let this verdict be a reason to inspire more trust in the judicial system, lest the court of public opinion be on the wrong side of history, this time around.
