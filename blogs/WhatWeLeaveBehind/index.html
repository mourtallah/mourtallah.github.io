                    i bookmarked Jordan Kong's landing page and in early June because it was the kind
                     of vibe I wanted to have with my personal blog. I spent some time going through her posts. 
                     The early one when she was an undergrad at CU, just to see what kind of content she posted 
                     and how when she starting building out her blog.

                <p>
                    the sushi cat game I found going through Jordan's old posts...it was lowkey pretty fun. 
                    I wonder if she still plays it. Or perhaps plays some other similar game. 
                    Or maybe she has given up on mobile games since, as if it were a vice.
