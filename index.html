Hi! 

Welsome to what will soon be mourtallah.com (as soon as I buy the domain haha)

My name is Mourtallah Faye, I am a aspiring data science pratitioner and statistician
finishing my last year at Columbia. 

I've decided to take up the project of creating a homepage for myself from scratch, and as you can see I am starting from ground zero. A lot of this front end stuff is brand new to me so I am sure I will learn a ton of skills and be able to share my progress as it grows into some really cool. 

So forgive the appearance, we are under construction! 

Thanks for stopping by, and here is a poem just because I love poetry.

Knows how to forget!
Emily Dickinson, 1830 - 1886

Knows how to forget!
But could It teach it?
Easiest of Arts, they say
When one learn how

Dull Hearts have died
In the Acquisition
Sacrificed for Science
Is common, though, now —

I went to School
But was not wiser
Globe did not teach it
Nor Logarithm Show

“How to forget”!
Say — some — Philosopher!
Ah, to be erudite
Enough to know!

Is it in a Book?
So, I could buy it —
Is it like a Planet?
Telescopes would know —

If it be invention
It must have a Patent.
Rabbi of the Wise Book
Don’t you know?
