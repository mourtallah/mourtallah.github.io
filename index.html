	Welcome to what will soon be mourtallah.com 
	(as soon as I buy the domain haha) 

	<br><br> My name is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/a.milkshake.named.moot/">  Mourtallah Faye </a> , 
I am a aspiring data science pratitioner and statistician finishing my 
last year at Columbia. <br><br> I mostly work with R for statistical 
analysis and modeling, and know quite a bit of SQL but I've decided to 
take up the project of creating a homepage for myself from scratch:no Wix, no Wordpress, no Blogger. As you can see I am 
starting from ground zero. A lot of this front end stuff like css 
and html is brand new to me so I am sure I will learn a ton of skills 
and be able to share my progress as it grows into some really cool. New 
projects coming soon! <br><br> So forgive the appearance, we are under 
construction! <br><br> Thanks for stopping by, and here is a poem just 
because I love poetry and I love to share what I love. <br><br>All the bests,<br> -m <br><br> Knows how 
to forget!<br> Emily Dickinson, 1830 - 1886 <br><br> Knows how to 
forget!<br> But could It teach it?<br> Easiest of Arts, they say<br> 
When one learn how<br> <br><br> Dull Hearts have died<br> In the 
Acquisition<br> Sacrificed for Science<br> Is common, though, now -<br> 
<br><br> I went to School<br> But was not wiser<br> Globe did not teach 
it<br> Nor Logarithm Show<br> <br><br> 'How to forget'!<br> Say - some - 
Philosopher!<br> Ah, to be erudite<br> Enough to know!<br> <br><br> Is 
it in a Book?<br> So, I could buy it -<br> Is it like a Planet?<br> 
Telescopes would know -<br> <br><br> If it be invention<br> It must have 
a Patent.<br> Rabbi of the Wise Book<br> Don't you know?<br> <br>
