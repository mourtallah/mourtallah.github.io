<strong> Knows how to forget!
			<br> by Emily Dickinson, 1830 - 1886 
			</strong><em><br><br> Knows how to forget!
			<br> But could It teach it?
			<br> Easiest of Arts, they say
			<br>When one learn how
			<br> <br><br> Dull Hearts have died
			<br> In the Acquisition
			<br> Sacrificed for Science
			<br> Is common, though, now -
			<br>
			<br><br> I went to School
			<br> But was not wiser
			<br> Globe did not teach it
			<br> Nor Logarithm Show
			<br> <br><br> 'How to forget'!
			<br> Say - some - Philosopher!
			<br> Ah, to be erudite
			<br> Enough to know!
			<br> <br><br> Is it in a Book?
			<br> So, I could buy it -
			<br> Is it like a Planet?
			<br> Telescopes would know -
			<br> <br><br> If it be invention
			<br> It must have a Patent.
			<br> Rabbi of the Wise Book
			<br> Don't you know?
