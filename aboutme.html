			I mostly work with R for statistical
			analysis and modeling, and know quite a bit of SQL but I've decided to
			take up the project of creating a homepage for myself from scratch:no Wix, no Wordpress, no Blogger. As you can see I am starting from ground zero. A lot of this front end stuff like css and html is brand new to me so I am sure I will learn a ton of skills and be able to share my progress as it grows into some really cool. New projects coming soon! 
			<br><br> So forgive the appearance, we are under
			construction!
